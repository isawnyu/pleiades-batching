## General information that we still need:

 * Full bibliographic information for TIR
 * List of individuals to be credited as "Creators" for these records (i.e. you?)
 * List of individuals (if any) to be credited as "Contributors" for these records (e.g., Michael?)

## For places:

 * Is it possible to be specific about the "type" of ancient place, or should we provisionally classify these as simply "findspot"s? The Pleiades "place type" vocabulary is here: https://pleiades.stoa.org/vocabularies/place-types

## For names:

 * Modern or historical? (see "Era" column in spreadsheet)

## For locations:

 * GeoNames/GeoHack links?

## Doublets/Redundancies:

* Yotvata is already in Pleiades: [(B)Ossia/Ad Dianam?](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/746721). The alternate names (including Yotvata) are still needed; I've consolidated them on the "PleiadesDifferentNames" sheet.

* Rehovat in the Negev is already in Pleiades: [Betomolachon](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687860). The alternate English name is still needed; I've put it on the "PleiadesDifferentNames" sheet. 

* El-Kursi is already in Pleiades: [Chorsia](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678093). The Alternate Arabic name is still needed; I've put it in the "PleiadesDifferentNames" sheet.

* Beit Yerah is already in Pleiades: [Philoteria](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678333). The Alternate Arabic and Hebrew names are still needed; I've put them in the "PleiadesDifferentNames" sheet.

* Umm al-Jimal is already in Pleiades: [Umm el-Jimal](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678439). Since "al-Jimal" is an alternate transliteration of [the modern Arabic name already in Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678439/umm-el-jimal), I've added it to the "romanized" field on that name resource and added you and Michael as "contributors". I've removed the corresponding entry from your spreadsheet so it doesn't get re-created as a separate place.

## Items to re-check for possible duplication:

* Is Fiq the same as [Apheka (Afiq)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678021)?

* Ein Semsem is close to [Na'aran](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678291). Are they indeed distinct?

* Kibbutz Lahav is close to [Thala](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/688038). Are they indeed distinct (your coordinates appear to be accurate for the kibbutz; I'm worried the Thala ones may be not so good)?
